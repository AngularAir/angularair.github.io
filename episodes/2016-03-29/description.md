The Angular Air host, [Jeff Whelpley](https://twitter.com/jeffwhelpley), and one of the panelists, 
[Patrick Stapleton](https://twitter.com/gdi2290), are two of the core contributors to the 
[Angular Universal](https://github.com/angular/universal) project which enables 
[Angular 2 to render on the server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wvZ7gakqV4). This is going to be our opportunity to pick their 
brains about isomorphic rendering and full-stack JavaScript development with Angular 2. 
This show is going to be epic!ï»¿
