[Dmitriy Shekhovtsov](https://github.com/valorkin) and [Jurgen Van de Moere](https://twitter.com/jvandemo)
are among the many early adopters of Angular 2. Typically the best way to learn any
new framework is to write code using that framework. Dmitriy wrote 
[ng2-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap), an Angular 2
library that wraps Bootstrap. Jurgen ported a version of 
[Minesweeper](http://www.jvandemo.com/how-to-build-minesweeper-using-angular-2-and-immutable-js/) 
to Angular 2. Tune in to hear their experiences and learn the ins 
and outs of authoring open source libraries on top of Angular 2.
