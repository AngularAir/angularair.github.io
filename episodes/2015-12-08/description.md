[Dmitriy Shekhovtsov](https://twitter.com/valorkin) and [Nathan Walker](https://twitter.com/wwwalkerrun) are among the many early adopters of Angular 2. 
Typically the best way to learn any
new framework is to write code using that framework. Dmitriy wrote 
[ng2-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap), an Angular 2
library that wraps Bootstrap. Nathan wrote [ng2-image-lazy-load](https://github.com/NathanWalker/ng2-image-lazy-load)
which lets you download images on the fly after your Angular 2 has loaded.
Tune in to hear about their experiences and learn the ins 
and outs of authoring open source libraries on top of Angular 2.
