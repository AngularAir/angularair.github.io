Angular is an awesome framework to use, and it's awesome to contribute to as well! Pawel works at
[Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com/) and spends most of his time working on Angular core
([Pawel's commits](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commits?author=pkozlowski-opensource)). Rodric is a CS student
who spent a summer at Google working on the Angular project
([Rodric's commits](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commits?author=rodyhaddad) <-- notice that even though his
internship is long over, he's still actively working on the project :-D). We're excited to have a chat with them about
committing to the Angular project and help us know how we can too!
