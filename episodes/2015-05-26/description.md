Web components are the future of the web (whether you like it or not). Join us with our guests who have some good
experience with web components and how they fit quite nicely with Angular 1 and how they'll fit even more nicely with
Angular 2. Rachael and Kara gave [a splendid talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbunztfV5vU) at ng-conf in March on
using Web Components with Angular (1 and 2), and Rado
[co-presented on Angular 2 template syntax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dMBcqwvYA0) with Mi≈°ko Hevery (at
ng-conf as well).
