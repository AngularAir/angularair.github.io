Life is more fun with more variety. That's why we're excited to announce that we've added a panel of some terrific
Angular community members to come join us on the show each week. Here's your chance to meet and get to know each of them
and their background and experience in Angular. We'll each supply an angular pro-tip / horror story or two as well, so
you don't want to miss this one!
