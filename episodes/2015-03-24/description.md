Jason Dobry is the author of several popular JavaScript libraries. A few of these include angular-cache and js-data
(formerly angular-data, but has evolved into a VanillaJS solution with an awesome Angular adapter). We're going to chat
with Jason about what it's like to develop a popular open source library. How to get started, how to triage GitHub
issues, documentation. The works. You know that library you've been wanting to write, or that code you want to open
source? This is the episode for you to learn what to expect.
