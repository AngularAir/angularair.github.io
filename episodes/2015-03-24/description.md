Jason Dobry and Olivier Combe are each authors of popular Angular libraries. Jason is wrote
[angular-cache](https://github.com/jmdobry/angular-cache) and [js-data](https://github.com/js-data/js-data)
(formerly angular-data, but has evolved into a VanillaJS solution with an awesome
[Angular adapter](https://github.com/js-data/js-data-angular)). Olivier wrote
[ocLazyLoad](https://github.com/ocombe/ocLazyLoad) and
[angular-localForage](https://github.com/ocombe/angular-localForage). And our regular host, Kent C. Dodds is responsible
for [angular-formly](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly) and [ng-stats](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng-stats).
Together we'll chat about what it's like to develop a popular open source library. How to get started, how to triage
GitHub issues, documentation. The works. You know that library you've been wanting to write, or that code you want to
open source? This is the episode for you to learn what to expect.
