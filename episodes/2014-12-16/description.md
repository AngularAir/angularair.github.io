Brian Ford (Angular core team member) will join with Todd and Kent in this episode of Angular Air to talk about Angular
Development Tools. Specifically the new version of AngularJS Batarang (the Chrome Extension no Angular developer should
work without) and Angular Hint (a JSHint-like runtime tool for Angular applications).
