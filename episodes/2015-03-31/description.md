Internationalization (generally referred to as i18n because that's frankly easier to tweet) is a big deal when the
entire world can reach your application. Pascal, the creator of
[angular-translate](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate) has put a lot of time and effort into making
applications accessible to anyone anywhere. And with some exciting things brewing for i18n in Angular, we're excited to
invite Pascal to chat with us about what's coming.
